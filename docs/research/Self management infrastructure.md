# Self-management infrastructure

It's better to plan with text and then make a cool diagram.

Self management
- Planning
  - Calendars
  - Task lists
    - Habits
    - Shopping lists
  - Statistics based planning
- Monitoring
  - Apps
  - Live actions
  - Geolocation
  - Finances
    - Bank account APIs
    - Checks
    - Various stores APIs
- Control
  - Dialogue based replanning & self control
  - Focus helping

There is a reasoning part that precedes planning, but I prefer not to automatize it right now.
